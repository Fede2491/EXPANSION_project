  --> This notebook provides the complete pipeline for generating jet images from the dataset JETCLASS:: A Large Dataset for DeepLearning in Jet Physics (link: https://zenodo.org/records/6619768).
      Starting from a ROOT file, the data loader loads the main features related to jet physics (pseudorapidity, azimuthal angle, etc.).
      The data loader used in this notebook is taken from:  https://github.com/jet-universe/particle_transformer/blob/main/dataloader.py
